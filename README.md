# Scaffolding-and-Differentiation-for-Second-Grade

This tool is designed to assist second-grade teachers in leveraging AI models like Perplexity.ai to generate tailored learning resources, with a special emphasis on scaffolding and differentiation to cater to diverse learning needs, including English Language Learners (ELL) and neurodiverse students.

## Features

This repository includes:

1. **Field Trip Guide Creator**: A prompt to generate a student-facing field trip guide, detailing relevant information, individual tasks, and group tasks tailored for second graders.

2. **ESL Adaptation**: A prompt to create a simplified, more accessible version of the guide that supports second-grade English language learners from diverse linguistic backgrounds.

3. **Neurodiversity Inclusion**: A prompt to develop a variant of the guide that considers the needs and strengths of neurodiverse students, including those with ADHD, Autism, and more.

## Prompts
```
1. Write a field trip guide for a trip to Sanborn County Park in Saratoga, CA, for second graders. Create a student-facing guide with relevant info, independent task descriptions, and collaborative tasks. Write in a style and format appropriate for second grade students.

Here is info about Sanborn County Park that I would like you to reference:
-Sanborn County Park is a big park in the Santa Cruz Mountains, near the city of Saratoga in California. Here are some fun things to know about the park:
-Sanborn County Park has lots of trees, including redwoods and tan bark oak.
-There are over 15 miles of trails in the park, which means you can go on a long hike and see lots of cool things.
-You can go camping in the park, either in an RV or by walking in with your camping gear.
-There are places to have a picnic and cook food on a BBQ grill.
-In the summer, there is a special event where people perform plays by William Shakespeare outside.
-The park is home to many animals, like birds, deer, and squirrels.
-The park is open all year, but you can't go in after the sun sets.
-To get to the park, you have to drive on a road called Sanborn Road. It's about 2 miles from the city of Saratoga.â€¨If you want to go on a hike in Sanborn County Park with your family, the San Andreas and Madrone Loop trail is a good one to try.

2. I have several ESL learners in my classroom (Hebrew speakers from Israel, French speakers from France, Mandarin speakers from China, and Spanish speakers from Colombia.) Please write a version that will communicate the same info in a simpler more accessible way for these 2nd grade English language learners.

3. Some of my students are neurodiverse (ADHD, Autism, etc.). Please provide a version of the guide that includes these considerations.

## Usage

To use this repository:

1. Browse through the repository to find the guide template prompt that aligns with your teaching needs.
2. Copy the chosen prompt.
3. Paste it into your AI model (like Perplexity.ai).
4. Review the AI-generated output, editing as necessary to ensure it matches the comprehension levels and needs of your specific student groups.
5. Implement the refined guide in your classroom.

Remember, while AI can produce creative and relevant content, it requires your professional judgement to refine it to the context and needs of your learners.
